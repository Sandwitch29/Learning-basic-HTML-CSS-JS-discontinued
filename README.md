# Learning basic HTML, CSS, JS (discontinued)
Welcome to this old front-end programming project of mine! I created it 2 years ago when I was starting out with basic skills in this area. Now, it's no longer being
worked on - but hey, why let that hold you back from checking it out? Just a heads up though: the code is totally aweful - bad, unoptimized, embarassingly so. It's so
bad that it's actually kind of funny, so feel free to poke fun at it all you want. In fact, I encourage it! You can download it and play around with it as much as you
want - the possibilities for making it even worse are endless! Seriously though, if you're looking for an example of how not to write code, this project could be right
up your alley. So have fun with it, and don't forget to laugh at my expense!
