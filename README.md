# Learning basic HTML, CSS, JS (discontinued)
 Hey there! This front-end programming project is something I created 2 years ago when I was just starting out with basic skills in this area. Unfortunately, it is no longer under development - but don't let that stop you from taking a look at the code! Just be warned - it's terrible! It's so bad and unoptimized that it's almost laughable, so feel free to poke fun at it as much as you want. But seriously, if you're looking for a good example of how not to write code, this project could be just what you need. So go ahead and download it, play around with it, modify it however you like, and enjoy the hilariously bad coding experience!
